"""Agent registry — maps agent name to its analyze() function.

All 9 functional agents (Ocean, Satellite, Weather, GIS, Fisheries,
Marine Ecology, Marine Risk, Anomaly, Data Validation) are in this
package. Agent 10 (ORCA Reasoning) is in pipeline/reasoner.py.

To add a new agent:
  1. Drop a file in this directory with a top-level `analyze(snap, ...)` function
  2. Register it in ALL_AGENTS below
