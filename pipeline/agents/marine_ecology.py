"""Agent 5: Marine Ecology 🐟

Combines ocean, satellite, and weather information to identify
potential ecosystem and productivity changes.

This is a "synthesis" agent — it reads the other agents' findings
and looks for cross-cutting patterns:
  - Bloom + warm SST = possible ecosystem shift
  - Upwelling (cold SST) + high chlorophyll = rich feeding zone
  - Fleet presence + chlorophyll = validated fishing ground

Inputs: ZoneSnapshot + other agent results
Outputs: dict of findings
