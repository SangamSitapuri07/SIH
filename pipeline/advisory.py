"""Deterministic safety advisory — the "Can I go out today?" card.

NO LLM. Every number comes from a live data source, every rule is a
published small-craft threshold, every verdict traceable to its reason.

Data woven together for one lat/lon:
  1. zone_snapshot        (SST, chlorophyll — existing ORCA pipeline)
  2. point forecast       (waves / wind / gusts / rain, next 72 h)
  3. INCOIS official PFZ  (nearest advisory line, distance + bearing)
  4. JTWC cyclones        (active tropical systems, distance)

Verdicts:
  go       → no reason at caution level or higher
  caution  → at least one caution-level reason, no no-go reason
  no_go    → at least one no-go reason

Rules (small-craft practice, WMO/IMD conventions):
  no_go    active cyclone within 300 km, or gale-force gusts ≥ 34 kn
           (WMO gale warning), or waves ≥ 4 m, or ≥ 64.5 mm rain day
           (IMD "heavy rain" threshold)
  caution  cyclone 300–800 km, winds 20–34 kn, gusts 28–34 kn,
           waves 2.5–4 m, swell ≥ 2.5 m, rain 35–64.5 mm day
  info     bloom-level chlorophyll (> 8 mg/m³) health note; PFZ context
